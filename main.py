# Exercise 6
from pathlib import Path

input_dir  = Path("data")

# 1. Read the Scene that you downloaded from the data directory using SatPy. [2P]

# 2. Load the composites "natural_color" and "convection" [2P]

# 3. Resample the fulldisk to the Dem. Rep. Kongo and its neighbours [4P] 
#    by defining your own area in Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area. 
#    Use the following settings:
#      - lat and lon of origin: -3/23
#      - width and height of the resulting domain: 500px
#      - projection x/y coordinates of lower left: -15E5
#      - projection x/y coordinates of upper right: 15E5 

# 4. Plot the resampled Scene on your screen in both loaded composites. [2P]
#    You don't have to save the images.
